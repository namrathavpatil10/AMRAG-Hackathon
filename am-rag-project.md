## Background
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of blindness, necessitating early detection and continuous monitoring to prevent irreversible vision loss. Existing AI models for DR lack interpretability and fail to incorporate dynamic patient data beyond static retinal images. This project aims to improve DR diagnosis using an **Agentic Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (AM-RAG)** framework, integrating retinal imaging, electronic health records (EHRs), and lab trends to enable dynamic risk stratification and case-based insights.

## Goal
- Develop and test a prototype of the AM-RAG framework during the hackathon.  
- Implement multimodal fusion of imaging biomarkers and clinical data using deep learning.  
- Enhance explainability by using retrieval-augmented generation to provide case-based insights.  
- Validate the framework using a public dataset like RFMiD or HAM10000.  

## Approach
1. Preprocess retinal fundus images and extract clinical features from EHRs and lab data.  
2. Develop a multimodal fusion model using attention-based mechanisms.  
3. Implement a retrieval engine to ground predictions based on similar historical cases.  
4. Design a clinician-in-the-loop workflow to refine predictions dynamically.  

## Expected Outcome
A working multimodal AI-based system capable of providing interpretable DR progression insights, facilitating more accurate diagnosis and risk stratification.
